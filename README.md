This is my simple .bat script which contains some registry tweaks, ability to launch my favourite PowerShell scripts, access some Control Panel applets (some have been hidden by Microsoft) & download and install some useful stuff for you.

It's main purpose is to reduce the time I spend setting up Windows to be my definition of 'perfect'.
